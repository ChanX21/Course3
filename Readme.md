## This Code Is Done As Part Of The Data Science Course " Getting and Cleaning Data Course "

** The Objective is to Extract Data From a Smartwatch Dataset accorind to certain requirements ( The Below steps are a rough summary of my code ) **

- Step 1 :  The Data Sets are assigned to each variables 
- Step 2 :  The XTotal ( Xtrain + XTest ) is named as with labels from features data set
- Step 3 : The YTotal is added an extra field "ActivityLabel" By Using factor with activity_labels dataset 
- Step 4 : The Final Data Set is formed by combining Xtotal , Subtotal and the modified Ytotal and is then subsequently grouped by acitivity type and subject
- Step 5 : The Final Output is Named As New " NewTidyOutput.txt"
